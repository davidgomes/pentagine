Pentagine
=========

About
-----
Pentagine is a Javascript lightweight library for HTML5 2D Game Development that renders to <canvas>. For now, it consists of a State Machine, a Sprite class to load and draw images and some keyboard input functions. Soon, I expect it to have much more.

Pentagine puts all its variables and functions on the **global namespace** and I do realize this is **not** recommended.

Thanks
------
I'd like to thank to [ippa](https://github.com/ippa/) because Pentagine is inspired on his HTML5 Game Development library, [jaws](https://github.com/ippa/). I also used some of his code, but this is not a fork, the two libraries are quite different.

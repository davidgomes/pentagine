Pentagine
=========

Pentagine is a Javascript lightweight library for HTML5 Game Development that renders to <canvas>. For now, it consists of a State Machine and a Sprite class to load and draw images. Soon, I expect it to have much more.

Pentagine puts all its variables and functions on the **global namespace** and I do realize this is not recommended.
